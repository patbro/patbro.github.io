title: About

I'm Patrick, I live in Eindhoven and I dedicate most of my time to working at [Prodrive Technologies](https://prodrive-technologies.com) as a mechatronics engineer. A place where I can truly thrive as a human-being. Most of my work spans the HR and software department.

The other hours of the day you can find me building oil separators and pickling bath solutions at [vanbroeckhuijsenvof.nl](https://vanbroeckhuijsenvof.nl), or other solutions at [Antrum Technologies](https://antrum-technologies.nl).

Over the weekend, I usually spend my time on a combination of software and electronic projects. These projects range from reverse-engineering the tennis court reservation app, to developing electronics for my home automation. The latter I might write an article about some time. Most of the software I write is open sourced on my [GitHub](https://github.com/patbro).

When I'm not building new things, I like to read and write about productivity. Writing - in general - helps me clear my mind, and by reading I gain new insights which I can apply in my daily life.

Usually, when you can't find me behind my desk, I'm breaking a sweat by going for a run before dawn or playing tennis.

### Get in touch

I enjoy learning new things and meeting new people with a proactive mindset, so consider this an open invitation to send a cold email.
